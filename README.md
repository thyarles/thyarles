## A little about me

I'm majored in **Computer Engineer**, MSc in **Mechatronic  Engineering**, and majoring (52% done) in **Statistics**.
I still have time for fun because work with IT is my favorite hobby, so **I have fun everyday**! How can I be more happier?
Yeah, a simple introduction because simplicity worths a lot to me! Want to known me a little better? Reach me out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thyarles) and [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/thyarles/badges).
