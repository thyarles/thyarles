<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=thyarles&show_icons=true&theme=light&count_private=true&hide_title=true" alt="stats" align="right">

I'm a **Computer Engineer**, MSc in **Mecatronic Engineering**, and majoring again in **Statistcs**.
I still have time for fun because work is my favorite hobby, so **I have fun everyday**! How can I be more happier?
Yeah, a simple introduction because simplicity worths a lot to me! Want to known me a little better? Reach me out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thyarles) and [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/thyarles/badges).
