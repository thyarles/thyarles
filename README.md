## Hey there!

🎓 I hold a degree in **Computer Engineering**, an MSc in **Mechatronic Engineering**, and have completed 50% of a major in **Statistics**. Currently, I am pursuing a **PhD in IT**.

😄 But don’t worry, my life isn’t all algorithms and data sets. **Working with IT is like my ultimate hobby**, so I’m having a blast every day! How can I crank up the happiness dial even more? That’s the million-dollar question!

✨ I like to keep things simple—because, honestly, simplicity is where it's at. If you’re curious to know more or just want to chat, hit me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thyarles) and [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/thyarles/badges).

🤝 Yeah, a simple introduction because, you know, I like simplicity! Let’s connect and make some digital magic happen!
